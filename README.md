DESCRIPTION :

Supermarkets and retail malls are springing up in ever-increasing numbers these days. Due to cheaper prices, a wider choice of product availability, and better service, individuals are shifting their shopping habits from traditional neighborhood general shops to supermarkets.As a result, we are seeing an increase in the number of individuals who buy at supermarkets and shopping malls. However, while shopping, everyone wastes the most of their time waiting in lines at the billing counters. Customers waste a lot of time waiting in line for checkout, especially at busy hours of the day, weekends, and during festivals.
The project’s major purpose is to cut down on total shopping time. The IoT Based Smart Grocery Store initiative intends to do this by allowing consumers to complete the
paying process on their mobile device while shopping using the IoT Based Smart Grocery where the QR Code is scanned and the products  are added into the cart avoiding long billing queues. Shopping malls may lower the number of people working at billing counters and the amount of space used, which saves time and money. These efforts and investments maybe put to bettering the quality and experience consumers.The main goal of our application is for supermarkets and retail malls are springing up in
